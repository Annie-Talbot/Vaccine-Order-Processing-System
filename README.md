# Vaccine Order Processing System
A project completed as part of my second year university module 'The C Family'. I achieved **100%** on this module.
The project was to create a command-line program that would take in an input file that represents instructions (vaccine orders, new customers, end of the day) for a few days and handle the instructions by sending off shipments and invoices to each customer at the end of each day.
